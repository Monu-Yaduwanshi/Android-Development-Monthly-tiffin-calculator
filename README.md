# Tiffin Calculator

The **Tiffin Calculator** is an Android application built using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **Firebase**. The app helps users calculate the completion date of their tiffin services based on missed meals (morning and evening) over a selected month. It allows users to input the number of missed meals and select a starting date, dynamically calculating the date of service completion while accounting for the number of days in each month, including leap years.

## Features
- **Date Selection**: Allows users to select a start date using a date picker.
- **Missed Meal Input**: Users can input the number of missed morning and evening meals.
- **Month Selection**: A dropdown to select the month, considering the number of days for each month.
- **Completion Date Calculation**: Based on missed meals and selected month, the app calculates the estimated completion date.
- **Firebase Database Integration**: Firebase is integrated for backend operations like data storage and retrieval (for further extensions).

## Project Structure
- **MainActivity**: The entry point of the app where the UI is set up with Jetpack Compose.
- **TiffinCalculator**: A composable function that handles the UI, user inputs, and completion date calculation.
